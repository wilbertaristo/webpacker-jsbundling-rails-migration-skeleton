# Webpacker to jsbundling-rails migration skeleton

I highly recommend reading the full walkthrough article here --> https://aristo.hashnode.dev/webpacker-to-jsbundling-rails-migration

This is a skeleton for my migration from Webpacker to jsbundling-rails.

This migration skeleton includes:
- Code splitting feature
- Separate builds for development and production environments
- Setup `webpack-dev-server` in development mode with hot reload
- Integration of `esbuild-loader` for fast build time
- Optimizations and minimizers for production environment
- Easy configuration changes in `webpack/config.js`
